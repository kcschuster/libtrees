# libtrees

C++ library implementing binary decision trees and random forests.

To compile, you'll first need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org).  Then type:

    cd libtrees
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

Example code to implement the library is coming soon.
